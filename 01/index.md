> Beauty and brains, pleasure and usability â€”

### Definition by Peter Morville

Product/Website/App/Service should be:
- Useful: should be original and fulfill a need
- Usable: must be easy to use
- Desirable: image, identity, brand, and other design elements are used to evoke emotion and appreciation
- Findable: needs to be navigable and locatable onsite
- Accessible: needs to be accessible to people with disabilities
- Credible: Users must trust and believe what you tell them
- Valuable: should create value for the stakeholder and should be valuable to the user

### The UX pyramid by Patrick W. Jordan

- Bottom level: Useful - The offered service and product features provide value to the user while supporting his basic needs.
- Middle level: Usable - The user is able to use the product easily. Effectiveness, Efficiency, Learnability, Error tolerent, Memorability
- Top level: Joy of Use, Beautiful, Aesthetic, Emotional

### Critics about UX

- We can't design the experience, everyone experiences differently.
- User Experience is not measurable

## Usability

The main question for usability is: What do users want to achieve with our service/product?

Usability is defined as the extent to which a user can use a specific product in a specific environment to efficiently accomplish his task.

Usability stands for the usability or user-friendliness of an interactive system. Interactive systems are systems that have a user interface and respond to user actions. These include simple machines as well as complex software systems. The term usability means that a system:
- is easy to learn
- has a low error rate (effective)
- is efficient to use
- satisfies the user

### The five E's according to Whitney Quesenbery

- Effective: How completely and accurately the work or experience is completed or goals reached
- Efficient: How quickly this work can be completed
- Engaging: How well the interface draws the user into the interaction and how pleasant and satisfying it is to use
- Error Tolerant: How well the product prevents errors and can help the user recover from mistakes that do occur
- Easy to Learn: How well the product supports both the initial orientation and continued learning throughout the complete lifetime of use

### Effectiveness

### Efficiency

### Satisfaction
